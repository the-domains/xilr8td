  No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side
  featuring a whopping 16 lenses. This visual assessment immediately reveals
  just how advanced the technology is within the device. When capturing an
  image, all lenses fire at different focal lengths and a computational software
  within the camera assembles them to maximize every pixel.
